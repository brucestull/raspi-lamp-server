# Request

I have a flask app running on a raspi zero w. Can I also add access point functionality to the zero w?

I want to connect a raspi pico w to the access point created on teh Zero W so that I can send HTTP requests from the pico to the zero.

### Response

Yes, you can configure your Raspberry Pi Zero W to function as both a WiFi access point and a server for your Flask app simultaneously. This allows you to create a local network to which other devices, such as your Raspberry Pi Pico W, can connect. This setup enables the Pico W to send HTTP requests to the Flask app running on the Zero W.

Here's a high-level overview of the steps involved in setting up your Raspberry Pi Zero W as an access point:

### Step 1: Update and Upgrade
First, ensure your Raspberry Pi Zero W's operating system is up to date by running:
```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

### Step 2: Install Required Packages
Install the necessary packages to turn your Raspberry Pi into an access point:
```sh
sudo apt-get install dnsmasq hostapd
```

After installation, stop these services as you will configure them:
```sh
sudo systemctl stop dnsmasq
sudo systemctl stop hostapd
```

### Step 3: Configure a Static IP
You need to assign a static IP address to the wireless interface (usually `wlan0`). Edit the `dhcpcd.conf` file:
```sh
sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
```
Add the following configuration to the end of the file:
```
interface wlan0
    static ip_address=192.168.4.1/24
    nohook wpa_supplicant
```
Restart the `dhcpcd` service:
```sh
sudo service dhcpcd restart
```

### Step 4: Configure the DHCP Server (dnsmasq)
Back up the original `dnsmasq` configuration file and create a new one:
```sh
sudo mv /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.conf.orig
sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf
```
Add the following configuration to the file:
```
interface=wlan0
dhcp-range=192.168.4.2,192.168.4.20,255.255.255.0,24h
```

### Step 5: Configure the Access Point
Create and edit the `hostapd` configuration file:
```sh
sudo nano /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
```
Add the following configuration (change `ssid` and `wpa_passphrase` to your desired network name and password):
```
interface=wlan0
driver=nl80211
ssid=YourNetworkSSID
hw_mode=g
channel=7
wmm_enabled=0
macaddr_acl=0
auth_algs=1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
wpa=2
wpa_passphrase=YourPassword
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
wpa_pairwise=TKIP
rsn_pairwise=CCMP
```

### Step 6: Enable and Start the Hostapd Service
Point `hostapd` to your configuration file by editing `/etc/default/hostapd`:
```sh
sudo nano /etc/default/hostapd
```
Find the line with `#DAEMON_CONF=""` and change it to:
```
DAEMON_CONF="/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf"
```
Enable and start `hostapd` and `dnsmasq` services:
```sh
sudo systemctl unmask hostapd
sudo systemctl enable hostapd
sudo systemctl start hostapd
sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq
```

### Step 7: Enable IP Forwarding and Configure a NAT
Edit `/etc/sysctl.conf` and uncomment the line `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`. Apply the changes:
```sh
sudo sysctl -p
```
Add a masquerade for outbound traffic on your eth0 connection:
```sh
sudo iptables -t nat -A  POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
sudo sh -c "iptables-save > /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat"
```
Ensure the iptables rule persists across reboots by editing `/etc/rc.local` and adding above the `exit 0` line:
```sh
iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat
```

### Step 8: Run Your Flask App
Make sure your Flask app is configured to run on `0.0.0.0` to allow connections from other devices:
```python
app.run(host='0.0.0.0')
```

### Step 9: Connect Your Raspberry Pi Pico W
With your Raspberry Pi Zero W configured as an access point, you can now connect your Raspberry Pi Pico W to the WiFi network you've created. Your Pico W can send HTTP requests to the Flask app on the Zero W using the Zero W's IP address in the URL (e.g., `http://192.168.4.1:5000` if your Flask app is running on port 5000).

This setup should allow for the functionality you described. Note that configuring a device as an access point and running server applications simultaneously can be resource-intensive, and the performance might vary depending on the workload and the capabilities of the Raspberry Pi Zero W.
