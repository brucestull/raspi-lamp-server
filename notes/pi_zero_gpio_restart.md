## Conversation

I'm running an access point on a raspi zero w.

Help me write a python script to restart the zero when GPIO pin 18 goes high?

Certainly! To write a Python script that restarts a Raspberry Pi Zero W when GPIO pin 18 goes high, you'll need to use the `RPi.GPIO` library for accessing the GPIO pins and the `subprocess` module to issue the command to restart the Raspberry Pi.

First, ensure you have the `RPi.GPIO` library installed. If it's not installed, you can install it via pip (assuming you have pip and Python installed):

```sh
pip install RPi.GPIO
```

Here's a simple Python script to accomplish what you're looking for:

```python
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import subprocess
import time

# Use the Broadcom SOC Pin numbers
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)

# Setup the pin with internal pull-down resistor
GPIO.setup(18, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_DOWN)

try:
    while True:
        # Check if the pin is high
        if GPIO.input(18):
            print("GPIO pin 18 is high. Restarting now...")
            # Command to restart Raspberry Pi
            subprocess.call(['sudo', 'shutdown', '-r', 'now'])
            
        # Wait for a bit to not overwhelm the CPU
        time.sleep(1)
        
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    # Clean up GPIO on CTRL+C exit
    GPIO.cleanup()
    
# Clean up GPIO on normal exit
GPIO.cleanup()
```

Save this script to a file, for example, `restart_on_gpio.py`.

### Important considerations:

1. **Running with Sudo:** The script uses `sudo` to perform a system restart, so it needs to be run with root privileges. You can do this by running `sudo python3 restart_on_gpio.py`.

2. **Pull-up/down Resistors:** This script assumes you're using the internal pull-down resistor (`GPIO.PUD_DOWN`). If your setup is different, you might need to adjust this.

3. **Safety and Security:** Automatically restarting a device based on a GPIO pin going high can have unintended consequences. Ensure that this behavior is what you want and consider the security implications.

4. **Running at Startup:** If you want this script to run automatically at startup, consider adding it to your `rc.local` file or creating a systemd service for it.

5. **Dependencies:** This script assumes you're running a Raspberry Pi OS or a similar distribution that includes the necessary GPIO libraries and permissions.

To clarify:

This pi zero is a headless access point. I want to create a way for the user to restart the zero without connecting to it using a monitor or having to connect via ssh. How best to let user restart the pi zero?

Given your scenario, using a physical button to trigger a restart is a practical and user-friendly solution. Here's a refined approach considering your headless Raspberry Pi Zero W setup:

1. **Physical Setup:** Connect a push button to GPIO pin 18 and a ground pin (GND) on the Raspberry Pi Zero W. This button will serve as the restart mechanism.

2. **Script Adjustments:** Modify the script slightly to ensure it's specifically looking for a button press event. Debouncing is also considered to prevent false triggers due to the mechanical nature of push buttons.

Here's the updated script:

```python
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import subprocess
import time

# Setup GPIO mode
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)

# Setup pin 18 as an input with an internal pull-down resistor
GPIO.setup(18, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_DOWN)

def restart_channel_callback(channel):
    # Detected button press, restart the Raspberry Pi
    print("Button press detected on GPIO pin 18, restarting...")
    subprocess.call(['sudo', 'shutdown', '-r', 'now'])

# Add event detection for a rising edge and debounce
GPIO.add_event_detect(18, GPIO.RISING, callback=restart_channel_callback, bouncetime=300)

try:
    # Keep the script running
    message = input("Press enter to quit\n\n")
finally:
    GPIO.cleanup()
```

### Instructions:

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect one side of the push button to GPIO pin 18 and the other side to any GND pin on your Raspberry Pi Zero W.

2. **Script Execution:** Run this script as root to ensure it has the necessary permissions to initiate a system restart. Use `sudo python3 your_script_name.py` to run it.

3. **Usage:** With this setup, the user simply needs to press the connected button, and the Raspberry Pi Zero W will safely restart.

4. **Autostart Option:** To make this script run at boot time, you can use `cron`, `rc.local`, or a `systemd` service. Using `rc.local` is straightforward:

    - Edit the `rc.local` file with `sudo nano /etc/rc.local`.
    - Add the following line before `exit 0` to run the script at boot: `python3 /path/to/your_script_name.py &`

Remember, the path must be absolute and point to where your script is saved. Ensure the script is executable and has the correct shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`) at the top.

This setup provides an accessible way for users to restart the headless Raspberry Pi Zero W access point without needing a monitor, SSH, or any network connection.
